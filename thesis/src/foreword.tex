After an embarrassing amount of delays,
the rocky journey---that writing this thesis has been---has finally come to an end.

I wish to thank my supervisor, professor Bo Tan,
for proposing the project for me,
helping me with the signal processing,
and the good literary pointers he gave,
and most importantly the ever-lasting patience it must have required to put up with my slow pace of writing.

Additionally, I must thank my current employer Insta Advance and my foreman Teemu for allowing me time off to focus on finishing the thesis.
Special thanks also go to my friends who have provided my with much-needed peer support (and pressure),
to my family and to my partner, Elina, who have supported me through all the hardships.

I must also thank processor Mikko Valkama for agreeing to examine this thesis.
Thank you too, doctor Joonas SÃ¤e. You know why.
