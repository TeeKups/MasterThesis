Carrying out this thesis has been a significant learning experience,
and I wish to thank the individuals who have contributed to this accomplishment.

I am utmost grateful for my supervisor, professor Bo Tan, for proposing this project to me
and offering his guidance. Without his enthusiasm and feedback, the end result would not have been half as good.
Under his guidance, my knowledge of radar processing also increased significantly.
I would also like to thank my second supervisor, Dr. Joonas SÃ¤e,
for his help in refining the quality of the literary product.

Special thanks must also be given to my current employer Insta Advance
and to my foreman, Teemu Kankaanranta, for allowing me the necessary resources
for finishing the literature part of this thesis.

My gratitude also extends to my friends, to my family, and to my partner Elina,
who have supported me through this process and pushed me forward when I was lacking the resolve.

To everyone who has played a role, whether big or small, I extend my sincerest thanks.
Your contributions have enriched the quality of this thesis and have helped shape its final outcome.
It is with profound gratitude that I present this work,
hoping it will contribute to the field and inspire further exploration and research.
